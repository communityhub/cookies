## Ingredients

Amount  |  Ingredient
--------|------------
125g    |  butter, softened
        |
20g     |  caster sugar
40g     |  granulated sugar
50g     |  light brown demerara sugar
30g     |  dark brown soft sugar
        |
1 egg   |  lightly beaten
1 tsp   |  vanilla extract
        |
50g     |  self-raising flour
100g    |  brown flour
75g     |  porridge oats
        |
1/2 tsp |  salt
200g    |  chocolate chips

The mix of sugars is due to limited availibility in my kitchen and recorded for science.


## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C, gas mark 4

2. Cream butter and sugars, once creamed, combine in the egg and vanilla.

3. Sift in the flour and salt, then the chocolate chips.

4. Roll into walnut size balls, for a more homemade look, or roll into a long,
   thick sausage shape and slice to make neater looking cookies.

5. Freeze completely. Cooking from frozen leads to thicker cookies.

6. Place on ungreased baking paper. Bake for 9 minutes, till the cookies are just setting - the
   cookies will be really doughy and delicious.

7. Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to
   a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they
   don't all get eaten straight away!
