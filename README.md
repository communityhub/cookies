## Ingredients

Amount     |  Ingredient
--------   |------------
125g       |  butter, softened
           |
50g        |  dark brown soft sugar
125g       |  light brown demerara sugar
           |
1 egg      |  lightly beaten
1 1/2 tsp  |  vanilla extract
           |
100g       |  self-raising flour
125g       |  porridge oats
100g       |  brown flour
           |
1 tsp      |  salt
200g       |  chocolate chips (55% cocoa)

Experimenting with more self raising flour in the hope of getting a better shape and to restore the
volume we've lost by reducing the sugar by so much.

Creates 7 large cookies.

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

2. Cream butter and sugars, once creamed, combine in the egg and vanilla.

3. Sift in the flour and salt, then the chocolate chips.

4. Roll into lemon sized balls and then flatten out to about 2.5cm thick. The cookies don't melt
   down much during baking due to the flour content.

5. Place on ungreased baking paper. Bake for 8 mins.

6. Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to
   a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they
   don't all get eaten straight away!


# Results

- A decent balance of flour, sugar and oats. Generally a really nice cookie.

- Keen to experiment with a more flour based cookie as I think the oats are a little heavy if you're
  not used to them. I am aware that they might not be broken down much by the baking and uncooked
  oats are quite tough on the digestive system!
