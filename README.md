Amount     |  Ingredient
--------   |------------
125g       |  butter, softened
           |
33g        |  dark brown soft sugar
66g        |  light brown demerara sugar
           |
1 egg      |  lightly beaten
1 1/2 tsp  |  vanilla extract
           |
175g       |  self-raising flour
75g        |  porridge oats
100g       |  brown flour
           |
1 tsp      |  salt
200g       |  chocolate chips (55% cocoa)

Experimenting with more self raising flour in the hope of getting a better shape and to restore the
volume we've lost by reducing the sugar by so much.

Creates 7 large cookies.

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

2. Cream butter and sugars, once creamed, combine in the egg and vanilla.

3. Sift in the flour and salt, then the chocolate chips.

4. Roll into lemon sized balls.

5. Place on ungreased baking paper. Bake for 8 mins.

6. Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to
   a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they
   don't all get eaten straight away!


# Results

- Way too floury. Starting to taste a little bit like a scone and sitting quite heavily after
  eating. 

- Additionally the increase in volume without changing the sugar content makes it even less sweet
  and we're now down to dangerously low sugar levels.

- Finally, the increase in volume without more oats leaves it is a much less oaty experience which
  seems regretable upon tasting.
