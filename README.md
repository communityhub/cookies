## Ingredients

Amount     |  Ingredient
--------   |------------
187g       |  butter, softened
           |
50g        |  dark brown soft sugar
100g       |  light brown demerara sugar
           |
2 egg      |  lightly beaten
2 tsp      |  vanilla extract
           |
75g        |  self-raising flour
150g       |  brown flour
112g       |  porridge oats
           |
1 1/2 tsp  |  salt
300g       |  chocolate chips (55% cocoa)

This is 1.5x larger batch than the last lot.

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

2. Cream butter and sugars, once creamed, combine in the egg and vanilla.

3. Sift in the flour and salt, then the chocolate chips.

4. Roll into lemon sized balls.

5. Freeze completely. Cooking from frozen leads to thicker cookies.

6. Place on ungreased baking paper. Bake for 11 + 2 minutes (still trying to figure out the time.)

7. Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to
   a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they
   don't all get eaten straight away!


# Results

- Cookies come out with about as little sugar as you'd want whilst still tasting good.

- Plan to experiment with adding more self-raising flour to try to make them lift a little more.
  We've also reduced the sugar by so much that there is potentially a loss of volume to be
  compensated for.
